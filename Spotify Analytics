# I performed analytics on the data using SQL 

#Determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.

#Created a Common Table Expression.Calculated the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. 
Then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a “Top Star”.
